# LevNet: A CNN architecture for optimizing the levitation of spherical particles through sound

This project follows the implementation of CNNs trained on ImageNet, and inspired from a modified version of UNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) for biomedical image segmentation. The reference architecture has been successfully used for particle volume reconstruction from an in-line hologram, replacing digital holography (https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-58-8-1900). We propose an approach that maps the positions of an arbitrary number of levitated particles, represented as a 2d image, to the phases of 512 transducers that create pressure traps in space.
