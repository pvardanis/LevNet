# LevNet: A Deep Learning architecture for optimizing the levitatiton of spherical particles through sound

This project follows the implementation of a modified version of UNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) for biomedical image segmentation. The sole purpose of this model is to map an arbitrary number of levitated particles, represented as a 2d image, to the phases of 512 transducers that create pressure traps in space.
