# LevNet: A CNN architecture for optimizing the levitation of spherical particles through sound

This project follows the implementation of CNNs trained on the ImageNet dataset, and is inspired from a an architecture that has been successfully used for particle volume reconstruction from an in-line hologram, replacing digital holography (https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-58-8-1900). This that maps the positions of an arbitrary number of levitated particles, represented as a 2d image, to the phases of 512 transducers that create pressure traps in space.
